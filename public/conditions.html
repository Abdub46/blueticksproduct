        <h2>HYPERTENSION</h2>
        <h3>Definition of Hypertension</h3>
        <p class="redressed-regular">
            Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a chronic
            medical condition in which the force of blood
            against the artery walls is consistently too high,
            usually defined as systolic ≥140 mmHg or diastolic
            ≥90 mmHg. It increases the risk of heart disease,
            stroke, kidney disease, and other complications
            if left uncontrolled.
        </p>
        <h4>Interventions:</h4>

        <h2>CANCER</h2>
        <h3>Definition of Cancer</h3>
        <p class="redressed-regular">
          Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by 
          the uncontrolled growth and abnormal spread of 
          cells in the body. These abnormal cells can 
          invade surrounding tissues and, if not 
          controlled, may spread (metastasize) to distant
          organs through the blood and lymphatic systems.
        </p>
        <h4>Interventions:</h4>
        <p>1. <b>Early Detection and Screening</b>
         Promote age- and risk-appropriate cancer screening 
         programs (e.g., breast, cervical, prostate, 
         colorectal) to enable early diagnosis and timely 
         management.</p>

         <p>2. <b>Health Education and Awareness</b>
         Educate individuals and communities on common
          warning signs of cancer, risk factors, and the 
          importance of early health-seeking behavior.</p>

         <p>3. <b>Lifestyle Modification</b>
         Encourage healthy behaviors, including a balanced
          diet rich in fruits and vegetables, regular 
          physical activity, avoidance of tobacco products, 
          and limitation of alcohol intake.</p>

         <p>4. <b>Infection Prevention and Control</b>
         Support prevention and treatment of cancer-related
          infections (e.g., HPV, Hepatitis B and C) 
          through vaccination, safe practices, and early
           treatment.</p>

         <p>5. <b>Timely Referral and Multidisciplinary Care</b>
         Ensure prompt referral to appropriate oncology 
         and specialized services for diagnosis, staging,
          and treatment using a multidisciplinary
           approach.</p>

         <p>6. <b>Treatment Adherence and Support</b>
         Support patients to adhere to prescribed 
         treatment plans, including surgery, chemotherapy,
          radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, or targeted 
          therapy, as recommended by specialists.</p>

         <p>7. <b>Psychosocial Support</b>
         Provide emotional, psychological, and social 
         support to patients and their families to improve 
         coping, mental well-being, and quality of life.</p>

         <p>8. <b>Nutritional Support</b>
         Promote adequate nutrition to support immune 
         function, maintain strength, manage treatment 
         side effects, and prevent malnutrition.</p>

         <p>9. <b>Palliative and Supportive Care</b>
         Integrate palliative care early to manage pain,
          symptoms, and distress, and to improve comfort 
          and dignity throughout the disease course.</p>

         <p>10. <b>Follow-up and Long-term Care</b>
         Encourage regular follow-up for monitoring 
         treatment response, detecting recurrence, 
         managing long-term effects, and supporting 
         survivorship care.</p>


        <h2>TUBERCULOSIS</h2>
         <h3>Definition of Tuberculosis</h3>
        <p class="redressed-regular">
            Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious
            disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
            primarily affecting the lungs (pulmonary TB)
            but capable of involving other organs such 
            as the lymph nodes, bones, kidneys, and 
            brain (extrapulmonary TB). TB is transmitted
            through airborne droplets when an infected
            person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. Without
            imely diagnosis and appropriate
            treatment, TB can result in severe
            illness, long-term disability, and 
            death, but it is both preventable 
            and curable.</p>


        <h4>Interventions:</h4>
        <p>
          1. Early Detection and Diagnosis
          Promote early identification of TB through 
          symptom screening, sputum examination, chest 
          imaging, and rapid diagnostic tests to enable 
          timely treatment initiation.</p>

          <p>2. Prompt Initiation of Treatment
          Ensure early commencement of standardized 
          anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens in 
          accordance with national and international 
          guidelines.</p>

          <p>3. Treatment Adherence and Completion
          Support strict adherence to the full course of 
          TB treatment to prevent treatment failure, 
          relapse, and development of drug-resistant TB.</p>

          <p>4. Infection Prevention and Control
          Implement appropriate infection control 
          measures, including cough etiquette, proper 
          ventilation, use of masks where indicated, and 
          isolation of infectious cases when necessary.</p>

          <p>5. Contact Tracing and Preventive Therapy
          Promote screening of close contacts and 
          provision of preventive therapy to eligible 
          individuals, especially children and 
          immunocompromised persons.</p>

          <p>6. Health Education and Community Awareness
          Educate patients, families, and communities 
          about TB transmission, symptoms, treatment 
          duration, and the importance of early 
          care-seeking behavior.</p>

          <p>7. Nutritional Support
          Encourage adequate and balanced nutrition to 
          strengthen immunity, support recovery, and 
          improve treatment outcomes.</p>

          <p>8. Management of Co-morbidities
          Screen for and manage conditions that increase 
          TB risk or complicate treatment, such as HIV, 
          
          diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and substance 
          use.</p>

          <p>9. Psychosocial Support and Stigma Reduction
          Provide counseling and social support to address 
          stigma, promote mental well-being, and improve 
          
          treatment adherence.</p>

          <p>10. Monitoring, Follow-up, and Outcome Evaluation
          Ensure regular follow-up to monitor treatment 
          response, manage side effects, and confirm 
          treatment completion and cure.</p>
